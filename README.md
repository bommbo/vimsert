Vimsert
=======

###Overview
Vimsert is a simple, open-source Chrome extension for editing inputs on the
web. It puts the power of Vim and the [Ace editor][ace_editor] together in the
browser. Better yet, it uses the awesome [Solarized][solarized_them] dark theme.

###Installation
From your chrome browser, [click here][vimsert_plugin] and 'add to chrome'.

###Usage:
Open the editor
    
    Ctrl + i # focus must be on a textarea

Write changes to the textarea

    :w

Close vimsert

    :q

Write, then Close

    :wq
